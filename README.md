##  Overview of the project

###  Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION ON "CALIFORNIA HOUSING" DATASET
Train a linear regression model using the training data to find the best-fit line that predicts the target variable. Then, use the trained model to predict values on the test data and evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

###  Key Activities
  - Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather data, clean it (handle missing values, outliers), and preprocess (normalize or scale features if necessary).

  - Feature Selection: Choose the relevant features that will be used as predictors in the model.

  - Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

  - Model Training: Initialize and train the linear regression model using the training data.

  - Model Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing set.

  - Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R²).

  - Model Tuning: Adjust model parameters or refine features to improve performance if necessary.

  - Visualization: Visualize the regression line, actual vs. predicted values, and residuals to understand model behavior and diagnose issues.

  - Deployment: Deploy the model for use in real-world applications, ensuring it performs well on unseen data.

  - Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it as needed to maintain accuracy and relevance.

###  Technologies and Libraries Used
  - Python: The programming language used to write the script.

  - Libraries:

      pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

      numpy: For numerical operations and array manipulation.

      matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.

      scikit-learn: For machine learning, including tools for model building, evaluation, and dataset loading.

  - Machine Learning Model:

      Linear Regression: A regression model used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictor variables.
    
  - Dataset:

      California Housing Dataset: A dataset included in scikit-learn for housing prices in California.
    
  - Data Handling:

      DataFrame: Using pandas DataFrame to store and manipulate tabular data.

      Train-Test Split: Using scikit-learn to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

  - Model Evaluation Metrics:

      Mean Squared Error (MSE): For measuring the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.

      R-squared (R²): For measuring the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).

  - Data Visualization:

      Scatter Plot: To visualize the relationship between median income and median house value.

      Regression Line: To show the fit of the linear regression model on the training data.

      Histogram: To visualize the distribution of residuals.
